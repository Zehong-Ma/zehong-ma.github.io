I am now a third-year Ph.D. student in [VMC group](http://www.pkuvmc.com/) under the supervision of Professor Shiliang Zhang at Peking University, Beijing, China. 

My research interests are computer vision and multimodal representation learning, including open-vocabulary recognition, multimodal large language model, and image/video generation.
